// Functions are a block of JavaScript code that can execute code when called.

// Functions can be called within a JavaScript and HTML file.

// Functions are useful, especially (but not limited to) when a user clicks on a button.


function myFunction() {
    console.log("The function works!");
}

// We don't need to use console.log to call a function. We can simply call the function by name, like so:
myFunction();
